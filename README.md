# Southern_Water_Corp_Case_Study
This is the guided case study a part of course work from Springboard Data Analytics Career Track 
Goal of this Case Study: understand the key drivers of anamoly happening within the Desalination unit and build a model that can predict pump failure.

Created a tool that predicts the likelihood of pump failure (accuracy:62%) and identified key features of pump failure to help management in making strategic changes interms of   maintenance and operation of Desalination unit.
Engineered and analysed dataset feature columns like Correlation matrix,Outliers,Quartiles using Descriptive Statistics methods and transformation of fields .
Optimized Linear Regression model with OLS evaluation function to reach the best model.

This is the repo for my first capstone project and it falls under "Anamoly Detection".From Sep 2019 to April 2020 I completed a number of projects as part of the Springboard Data Analytics Track.
