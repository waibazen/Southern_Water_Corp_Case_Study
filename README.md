# Southern_Water_Corp_Case_Study:Guided mini project
This is the guided case study a part of course work from Springboard Data Analytics Career Track 
Goal of this Case Study: understand the key drivers of anamoly happening within the Desalination unit and build a model that can predict pump failure.

<li>Created a tool that predicts the likelihood of pump failure (accuracy:62%) </li>
<li>identified key features of pump failure to help management in making strategic changes interms of   maintenance and operation of Desalination unit. </li>
<li>Engineered and analysed dataset feature columns like Correlation matrix,Outliers,Quartiles using Descriptive Statistics methods and transformation of fields .</li>
<li>Optimized Linear Regression model with OLS evaluation function to reach the best model.</li>

This is the repo of Case Study and it falls under "Anamoly Detection".From Sep 2019 to April 2020 I completed a number of  mini projects as part of the Springboard Data Analytics Track.
